## Meta Resource Lists

> Collections and indexes that help discover GPU platforms, credits, and grants.

- **cloud-gpu-servers-services-providers**  
  A large collection of cloud services with free tiers or credits (some GPU-capable).  
  https://github.com/devinschumacher/cloud-gpu-servers-services-providers

- **Deep-learning-in-cloud**  
  Overview of cloud GPU platforms and MLOps environments.  
  https://github.com/zszazi/Deep-learning-in-cloud

- **GPU-Grants**  
  A list of GPU grants and compute funding programs for research and startups.  
  https://github.com/eric-prog/GPU-Grants

- **AI-fundermentals**  
  GPU architecture and AI system fundamentals (learning-oriented).  
  https://github.com/ForceInjection/AI-fundermentals

## Sponsored / Grant-Based Compute

> High-quality compute support for **serious projects**.  
> Usually application-based, but significantly more powerful than public free tiers.

- **MiraclePlus Compute (奇绩算力)** ⭐  
  Project-based compute support backed by MiraclePlus (奇绩创坛).  
  Designed for AI researchers, builders, and early-stage teams.

  **Highlights**
  - Stable, long-running GPU workloads
  - Suitable for LLMs, multimodal models, RL
  - Often supports multi-GPU or high-end setups
  - Not a public free tier (application required)

  > Recommended if you are doing **real training**, not just notebooks.

---

## Public Free GPU Platforms

> Long-term or renewable free GPU access for learning and experimentation.

- **Kaggle Notebooks**  
  Weekly renewable GPU/TPU quotas (T4 / P100).  
  Ideal for coursework, experiments, and benchmarks.

- **Baidu PaddlePaddle AI Studio**  
  Daily compute points, supports GPU training.  
  Stable access in mainland China.

- **Tencent Cloud Studio (GPU Workspace)**  
  Monthly free GPU minutes (~10,000 minutes).  
  Browser-based development environment.

- **OpenI 启智平台**  
  Task-based point system to redeem GPU compute.

---

## Trial & Limited-Time GPU

> Useful for demos, short experiments, or quick prototyping.

- **Google Colab (Free Tier)**  
  GPU/TPU available, but unstable for long jobs.

- **AWS SageMaker Studio Lab**  
  Limited daily GPU access for learning and testing.

- **Huawei CodeLab / Alibaba Tianchi GPU**  
  Occasional free GPU quotas via events or programs.

---

## Student Programs

> Strongly recommended if you have a valid student email.

- **GitHub Student Developer Pack**  
  Includes:
  - $200/year DigitalOcean credits
  - Free GitHub Codespaces usage
  - Additional developer tools and learning resources

## Practical Tips

- Combine **Kaggle + Colab** for daily experiments
- Use **public platforms** for small or medium models
- Prefer **grant-based programs** for long-running or multi-GPU training
- Stability matters more than peak GPU specs for real research
